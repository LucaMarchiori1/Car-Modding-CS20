		<font color = "white"><h1> Cold Air Intakes </h1>
		<font color = "white"><h3> Typically cold air intakes are one of the cheapest and easiest mods to install to your car. Most cold air intakes go for a couple hundred dollars and take under an hour to install. Performance cold air intake can give your car a 5-10 horsepower gain. The more air the more power, so performance intakes allow for more air to get into the engine. They pull cooler (more dense) air into the engine which combust better.</h3>
