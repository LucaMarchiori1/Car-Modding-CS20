                <font color = "white"><h3>  A Turbocharger forces air into the engine, creating more power. The hot exhaust gasses spin one side of the turbocharger which then makes the other side spin, which sucks air in. Turbochargers are very beneficial because they do not need power from the engine to run.</h3>
